## Project Audience

The audience would be teens/young adults.

## Project Inspiration

The inspiration for this project idea was the fact that it can be hard to manage your time especially with teens (I would know). So I knew for this project pitch that I would like to make a scheduler app for teens/young adults. Having a coutdown timer would help with time appreciation. A summary also helps to lean how to better manage my time.
