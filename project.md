## TrueNet

A browser extension or filter that attempts to find the earliest publications of a statistic or claim. 

## Project Mini Pitch

This would quickly aid in finding the original studies from which data is taken, or the earliest articles in which it shows up, and allow us to more easily track whether a particular statistic is true and reputable, or whether it has been exagerated or fabricated.   

## Project Description

It would either be a browser extension or independant app that searches the internet with a filter to show the oldest pages containing the key words or phrase used in the search. By looking at the oldest pages, you will either be very close to the origin of the claim, and therefore be able to read a small number of articles and judge their reliability. If they do not seem reliable, it is likely to be an exageration of the original data or a statistic without an actual source. The end goal is to get as close to the true source as possible, and avoid the interpretations of interpretations of the report that can gradually get further from the truth.     

## Project Audience

It would be most useful to today's youth, who spend far more time on the internet than any other demographic; this would help them navigate around misleading claims and data, though it would really be useful to anyone who gets their information digitally. As a side benefit it might be a useful research tool.  

## Project Inspiration

This idea was inspired by a lesson in my political science class on the evolution of a news report - how it stems from a particular event or piece of data, then a few days later an altered story gets published, then an interpretation of that one, until eventually each story is based off of layers of interpretations and bears little resemblance to the original report.

As an important note, I don't fully understand the extend of coding and whether or not this would be at all achievable within the confines of our skill level and timeline; it may very well be ridiculous and unfeasible, but I think it is at least creative, and if it is doable, then quite useful.
