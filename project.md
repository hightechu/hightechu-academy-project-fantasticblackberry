## Project Title

B.I.G.
Books Incur Genius

## Project Mini Pitch

Teenagers don't read enough, but by supplying an easier access to material, social connections, and relevant reviews we hope to change that.

## Project Description

The app is designed to facilitate reading for teenagers by creating profiles and sorting relevant reviews based on: friends on other social platforms, previous reads, personal interests, and more.

## Project Audience

This app is designed for use by teenagers on Vancouver island, but as it develops it could be expanded to include other areas and ages.

## Project Inspiration

Personally I often find myself running out of good books to read, and talking to my partner for the design activity I realised that I don't have a lot of friends that I spend much time with. So I thought to create an app that could remedy both problems. By providing a platform that offers rewards for finishing and reviewing books, I could encourage others to read, and by linking in to other social networks I could track friends who make profiles for BIG. They simply have to record what book they are currently reading and it would appear to their friends on the platform, thus providing a way of viewing what your friends are enjoying or not enjoying.
