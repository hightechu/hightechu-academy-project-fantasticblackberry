## Project Title

StickyBoard: a whiteboard with stickers

## Project Mini Pitch

A whiteboard where users can collaborate by using a shared whiteboard, and uploading their own pictures as stickers. They can be placed on the whiteboard, and used by other people. Aimed at teenagers and college students to help them study in a group for tests and exams.

## Project Description

It's a web whiteboard that can be drawn on, and have text placed on. It can be shared via a link or code, allowing other users to view or edit the whiteboard in real time. Editors can also upload their own photos, turning them into stickers, which can be placed on the whiteboard. This would be useful for group studying as pictures, diagrams, or scans of textbook pages can be uploaded for everybody to see and work on.

## Project Audience

It would be a studying tool directed mainly at high school students and college students. In addition, while most of the features are for use by that audience, it would be useful for teachers or project teams as well, for discussing concepts with visual aid (remotely).

## Project Inspiration

This was inspired by some of the online whiteboards I've used, which can also be used in real time with others. In fact, AWW App is quite similar to my idea, though with two differences: some of its features require payment to be used, and uploading photos is often inefficient, slow, and doesn't always work.
