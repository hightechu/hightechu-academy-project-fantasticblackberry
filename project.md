# Project Idea Pitch

Edit this file to include your project idea pitch for the HighTechU Academy!!

## Project Title

Book finder for teens (terrible name for now sorry)

## Project Mini Pitch

An app for teens to read new books and make friends:)

## Project Description

There are so many good books for teenagers to read, but many online reviews are written by adults or bots. Because of this and social stigma, it can be incredibly difficult to find new books to read and to have friends to talk about books with. This app would take age into consideration when posting reviews, and allow users to interact as on social media, letting users make friends while reading good books.

Potentially, we could work with libraries to tell what books are in stock, so you can read without having to buy!

## Project Audience

The audience would be teens who love to read, and especially teens who want to make friends but are maybe shy in person or arounhd new people.

## Project Inspiration

Inspiration for this came from Jamie and I's conversation on Saturday, when we both found we love to read and that sometimes really good friends are very hard to come by. I had a few other thoughts, but this kept coming back and pushing them out!
