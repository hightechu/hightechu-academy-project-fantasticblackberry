Edit this file to include your project idea pitch for the HighTechU Academy.

## Project Title

SalesFinder

Example - Colour Picker

## Project Mini Pitch

this app is will streamline the process of finding the best deals at local stores

Example - This colour picker will revolutionaize the way colours are picked for the web.

## Project Description

This app will be ios/android based, being easily accessible as an app from your phone. The main idea is finding sales from essential everyday items to random things and compiling them into one convenient place for the average person to see. The main source for information would be provided through the user base itself, taking pictures in real-time of good deals in stores with the location and date (like social media for good deals).  Aside from the user base salesfinder will sort through store websites to find the best deals on products comparing other stores for the lowest price.  The appeal of this product is the use of it locally in victoria or where you live, accesing local shops and supermarkets that don't have an online presence and would otherwise go unnoticed by other apps like this.

Example - The app will be web based and allow users to pick a colour with the help of a colour wheel.

## Project Audience

Example - The audience would be frontend developers and designers looking to pick colours for their work.
