An app or website for teenagers to make money.

Teenagers want to make money, but it's hard to find a job while also being a full time student. This app would let people post work shifts with flexible hours as well as odd jobs, both physical and online.

## Project Title

I haven't thought of a  good title for this yet.

## Project Mini Pitch

This app would provide a way for busy teenagers to make some extra cash without completely filling up their schedule.

## Project Description

It will be an app for teenagers who are busy with school to make money on the side. They can take up odd jobs, as well as flexible shifts. Both physical and online jobs could be posted, for example if someone was making a personal website and wanted a cool banner at the top, they could make a post about wanting one, and if someone was interested they could go into further detail.

## Project Audience

The main audience of this app will be teenagers looking for a way to make some money while still being a full-time student.

## Project Inspiration

I didn't have a bunch of inspiration for this, but the app Fiverr gave me the idea for the online aspect of the odd jobs catagory. It also seems like something that I would use if it was available, which helped me to come up with some of the ideas.
