## Project Title

SalesFinder

## Project Mini Pitch

this app is will streamline the process of finding the best deals at local stores

## Project Description

This app will be ios/android based, being easily accessible as an app from your phone. The main idea is finding sales from essential everyday items to random things and compiling them into one convenient place for the average person to see. The main source for information would be provided through the user base itself, taking pictures in real-time of good deals in stores with the location and date (like social media for good deals).  Aside from the user base salesfinder will sort through store websites to find the best deals on products comparing other stores for the lowest price.  The appeal of this product is the use of it locally in victoria or where you live, accesing local shops and supermarkets that don't have an online presence and would otherwise go unnoticed by other apps like this.

## Project Audience

the audience would be the average person looking to save money, most likely, adults

## Project Inspiration

This project was inspired by apps like Honey that help you save money
